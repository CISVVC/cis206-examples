# Objects and Classes 

## Background

In a physical setting, the concept of an object is generally understood as something that can be
interacted with or perceived with the senses.  Objects are generally how humans perceive the
physical world.  Understanding an object is key to understanding object-oriented technology. 

If you look around, you many find examples of real-world objects: a computer, a lamp, a
phone, a ___you fill in the blank___ .  

**Real-world objects share two characteristics:** 
   They all have ***state*** and ***behavior***. 
   
Computers for instance, have state (type(laptop or desktop), brand(Dell, HP, etc . . .), color, etc
.. .) and behavior (turn on, display text, run game, etc . . .). LED Lamps also have state (light
color, brightness, on or off) and behavior (change color,
change brightness, turn off, and turn on). Recognizing the state and behavior for real-world
objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
